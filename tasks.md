# VS Code OpenAI Agent - Implementation Plan

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements
1. Develop a VS Code extension similar to GitHub Copilot/Codex
2. Integrate with OpenAI Assistants API using user-provided API key
3. Provide code completion and suggestions based on context
4. Support multiple programming languages
5. Ensure user data privacy and secure API key handling

### User Experience Requirements
1. Simple configuration and setup process
2. Intuitive UI for enabling/disabling the agent
3. Customizable suggestion behavior
4. Clear indication when suggestions are being generated

## Components Affected

### Extension Core
- Extension activation/deactivation logic
- Configuration management
- API key storage and validation
- Assistant and Thread management

### OpenAI API Integration
- Authentication mechanism
- Assistant creation and configuration
- Thread and message handling
- Response parsing and formatting

### Editor Integration
- Context gathering (current file, open files, workspace)
- Suggestion rendering and display
- User interaction with suggestions
- Keyboard shortcuts and commands

### Settings Management
- User preferences storage
- Default settings
- Settings UI

## Architecture Considerations

### Extension Architecture
- Use VS Code extension API for editor integration
- Implement service-based architecture with separation of concerns:
  - Editor Service: Handles VS Code integration
  - OpenAI Service: Manages API communication, assistants and threads
  - Suggestion Service: Processes and formats completions
  - Configuration Service: Manages user settings and assistant state

### Security Considerations
- Secure storage for API keys using VS Code Secret Storage API
- Minimal data transmission to OpenAI API
- Clear privacy policy and user consent mechanisms

### Performance Optimization
- Implement request debouncing and throttling
- Efficient thread management
- Background processing for non-blocking UI

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Extension Setup
1. Initialize VS Code extension project structure
2. Implement configuration and settings management
3. Create OpenAI API service with authentication
4. Set up basic command palette integration

### Phase 2: Assistants API Integration
1. Implement assistant creation and management
2. Create thread handling mechanism
3. Add message sending and receiving
4. Parse and format assistant responses

### Phase 3: Editor Integration
1. Implement context gathering from editor
2. Develop suggestion generation and rendering
3. Create completion provider integration with VS Code
4. Add basic inline suggestion UI

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Add status bar indicator
2. Implement context management commands
3. Add support for multiple completion styles
4. Improve response parsing and formatting

## Detailed Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Extension Setup
1. Initialize project with TypeScript configuration
2. Set up package.json with extension metadata
3. Implement extension activation and command registration
4. Create settings schema for configuration options
5. Implement secure API key storage
6. Set up basic OpenAI client

### Phase 2: Assistants API Integration
1. Implement assistant creation logic
2. Create assistant storage and retrieval
3. Implement thread creation and management
4. Add message handling for user context
5. Set up response parsing for code blocks

### Phase 3: Editor Integration
1. Create editor context gathering logic
2. Implement completion provider for VS Code
3. Add status bar indicators
4. Create suggestion rendering logic

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Add thread reset functionality
2. Implement assistant reset options
3. Improve context gathering strategies
4. Add inline completion support for newer VS Code versions

## Dependencies
1. VS Code Extension API
2. OpenAI Assistants API
3. Axios for HTTP requests
4. TypeScript/Node.js
5. VS Code secret storage API

## Challenges & Mitigations

### Challenge: API Rate Limiting
**Mitigation**: Implement request throttling and user notifications

### Challenge: Context Management
**Mitigation**: Provide thread reset functionality and optimize context gathering

### Challenge: Response Parsing
**Mitigation**: Implement robust parsing for assistant messages to extract code blocks

### Challenge: Security Concerns
**Mitigation**: Implement secure storage, minimal data transmission, and clear privacy policies

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
- Set up basic project structure
- Implemented API key configuration
- Created OpenAI Assistants API service
- Developed thread and assistant management
- Added completion provider
- Implemented status bar indicator
- Added context and assistant reset commands

### Next Steps
- Improve inline suggestions support
- Enhance context gathering strategy
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Create tests for the extension

### How to Test the Extension

1. Open VS Code with this project
2. Press F5 to start debugging
3. In the extension development host window:
   - Open the command palette and run "OpenAI Agent: Set API Key"
   - Enter your OpenAI API key
   - Start typing code to see suggestions
